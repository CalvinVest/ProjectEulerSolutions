## What is Project Euler?
<a href="https://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is an active online archive of math and programming challenges inspired by the works of mathemetician Leonhard Euler.
These problems allow the user to grow their own understanding of mathematical processes and programming techniques.
Problems are usually formatted to accept a single numerical response, either the result of a complex calculation or some unique chain of numbers indicative of a correct solution.

## Why'd I do this?
I started this project a few years ago as a small hobby program. It gave me the chance to work on my hobby programming proficiency in Java, and keep my math skills sharp as well.
I enjoy solving Project Euler's problems and this project is a great way for me to
<ul>
  <li>Expand my OOP knowledge</li>
  <li>Apply my own mathematics and programming skills</li>
  <li>Keep track of my own Project Euler progress</li>
  <li>Maintain consistent progress by breaking the project up into small additions with every problem</li>
</ul>

## Future Plans
I'd like to keep adding problem solutions as time goes on. There's no particular deadlines on this project since it's just a hobby but I'd like to have 100 problems completed by the end of Q2 2024.
