<h1>ProjectEulerSolutions</h1>
<p>An all-in-one java project for solving and navigating solutions for Project Euler.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING - This repository contains spoilers for Project Euler.</strong><br>
This site contains spoilers. Please close this page if you wish to solve the included Project Euler programs yourself.</p>

<h2>What is Project Euler?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a collection of math and programming problems, at all difficulties.<br>
These problems allow the user to grow their own understanding of mathematical processes and programming techniques.<br>
The problems are given as a mathematical problem with a single numerical response. It is up to the user to determine how they will find the answer.</p>

<h2>Why'd I do this?</h2>
<p>I started this project a few years ago as a small hobby program. I was able to apply my mathematical knowledge as I was learning Java programming.<br>
I enjoy solving Project Euler's problems and this project is a great way for me to<br>
<ul>
  <li>Expand my OOP knowledge</li>
  <li>Apply my own mathematics and programming skills</li>
  <li>Keep track of my own Project Euler progress</li>
  <li>Maintain consistent progress by breaking the project up into small additions with every problem</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>What's the vision?</h2>
<p>Going forward, I'd like to keep expanding this project.<br>
I'm planning to continue doing Project Euler problems for a good while, so this project is a great way to keep myself involved.<br>
As time goes on I'll be making occasional edits to the core functionality of the program, but the majority of updates will be to add new problem solutions.</p>

<h2>My Project Euler progress</h2>

<p>Not all of my Project Euler progress is recorded here yet. There's problems I've solved whose solutions are not included in this repository, but that should change with time. Stay tuned!</p>
