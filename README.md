<h2>What is Project Euler?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a collection of math and programming problems, at all difficulties.<br>
These problems allow the user to grow their own understanding of mathematical processes and programming techniques.<br>
The problems are given as a mathematical problem with a single numerical response. It is up to the user to determine how they will find the answer.</p>
<h2>Is uploading the answers here cheating?</h2>
<p>Project Euler discourages sharing and publishing solutions to their problems.<br>
This repository was not created simply to break this rule. I, instead, want to practice what I've been taught so many times:</p>
<p><em>Finding the answer is only half of the solution.</em></p>
<p>I'm not posting my solutions here so someone else can come along and just plug the answer into their own work.<br>
They <em>can</em>, but that's not the purpose of this repo. I'm posting my solutions as a demonstration of my understanding of the subject matter.</p>
<p>An overwhelming amount of what I know are things I've learned from somewhere else. That's most of the computer science field as a whole.<br>
Just because I found a single answer somewhere online doesn't mean I understand the process.<br>
Pretty much all of the work that I've put into these problems is applying prior knowledge in a new and creative way. Someone just copying my code to get the answer themselves is missing the point.</p>
