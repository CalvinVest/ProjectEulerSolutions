/*
The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111_2 and 11_6. In other words, 7 is a
repunit in at least two bases b > 1.

We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It can be
verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50:
{1, 7, 13, 15, 21, 31, 40, 43}/
Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below 1000 equals 15864.

Find the sum of all strong repunits below 10^12.
