The goal of problem 32 is to find the sum of all products whose
multiplicand/multiplier/product can be written as a 1 through 9
pandigital.

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes 
use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the
5-digit number, 15234 is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity 39 * 186 = 7254,
containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9
pandigital.
