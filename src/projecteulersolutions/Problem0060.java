/*
The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673 are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and
concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. For example,
taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of these four primes,
792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.

Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate
to produce another prime.
