/*
The goal of problem 26 is to find the number < 1000 for which
1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction
part.

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation
of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are:
1/2 = 0.5
1/3 = 0.(3)
1/4 = 0.25
1/5 = 0.2
1/6 = 0.1(6)
1/7 = 0.(142857)
1/8 = 0.125
1/9 = 0.(1)
1/10 = 0.1

1/6 has a 1-digit recurring cycle, the repeating 6.
1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle, the repeating 142857.
