/*
The goal of problem 50 is to find the prime below one million that can be written
as the sum of the most consecutive primes.

The prime 41 can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below 100.
The longest sum of consecutive primes below 1000 has 21 terms and is 953.
