The goal of problem 56:

A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 10^100
is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size,
the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the for a^b where a,b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
