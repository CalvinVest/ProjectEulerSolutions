/*
Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2^11 and 3^7 is not difficult,
as any calculator would confirm that 2^11 = 2048 < 3^7 = 2187.

However, confirming that
632382^518061 > 519432^525806
would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using problem0099.txt, a text file containing one thousand lines with a base/
exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest
numerical value.
