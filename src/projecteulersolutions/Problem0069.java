/*
Euler's totient function, phi(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is defined
as the number of positive integers not exceeding n which are relatively prime to
n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are less than or equal to nine and 
relatively prime to nine, phi(9) = 6.

It is understood that n=6 produces a maximum n/[phi(n)] for n <= 10, at 3. (6/2)

Find the value of n <= 1 000 000 for which n/[phi(n)] is a maximum.
