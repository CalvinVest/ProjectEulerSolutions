/*
The goal of problem 22 is to find the sum of all name scores for the given file

The file provided is a list of over 5,000 names.
The alphanumeric sum of a number is the sum of its characters a=1 values.
    For example, Colin's alphanumeric sum  is c=3 + o=15 + l=12 + i=9 + n=14 = 53
The score of a name is its alphanumeric sum times its place in the alphabetized list
    For example, Colin is 938th in the list, so Colin's score is 53 * 938

Plan:
Import list
Alphabetize list
Output list for debug
Implement alphanumeric sum function
Implement name score function
Sum name scores
Print solution
